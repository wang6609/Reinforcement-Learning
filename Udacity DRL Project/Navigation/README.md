# Navigation
## Deep Reinforcement Learning
Using Reinforcement Learning to solve a navigation problem. **Python3** and **PyTorch** is used. This is one of the projects of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

The goal of this project is to train an agent navigating in the world shown in the gif below, collecting as much yellow bananas as possible while avoiding toucing the blue ones.

The environment is provided by **Unity**. To play with this environment, please follow the described two steps:

*Step 1: Clone the DRLND Repository*

Please follow the [instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up your Python environment. These instructions can be found in 'README.md' at the root of the repository. By following these instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages required to complete the project.

*Step 2: Download the Unity Environment*

For this project, we can use the environment Udacity build. Put the **Banana.app.zip** (can be found in this folder) in the p1_navigation/ folder in the DRLND GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.
